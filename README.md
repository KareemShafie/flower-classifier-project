# Flower Classifier Project
A deep learning project for classifying flower images using a trained neural network
(Udacity – AI Programming with Python Nanodegree)

# 📌 Overview
This project builds a deep learning image classifier capable of recognizing flower types from images using a trained neural network.
The model was trained using transfer learning and evaluated for accuracy, generalization, and performance

# 🧠 Key Features
🌸 Classifies images into 102 flower categories

🚀 Utilizes Transfer Learning with a pretrained CNN

🧪 Includes a full training + validation + testing pipeline

🧹 Implements data preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization

🔍 Contains prediction script for testing your own images

💾 Trained model saved as: flower_classifier.h5

📜 Supports label mapping via label_map.json
